                Coffee. The first port of call Monday through Friday. I donâ€™t know about you but I am a creature of habit and tend to go to the same cafes near the office. Seems we all have the same idea so i wait in line to place my order. That is now a thing of the past with <BrandName />. As I approach the cafe each morning <BrandName /> asks if i would like to place my usual order. I accept and pay for my coffee with the push of a button. I take a seat and sit back and wait for <BrandName /> to prompt me when my order is ready.
